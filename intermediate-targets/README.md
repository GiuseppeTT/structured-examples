# Diamond analysis

## Description
This project consists of an analysis of the diamonds dataset, available at the `{ggplot2}` package. Particularly, we focus on the diamond prices and how to predict them based on other characteristics.

## How to run
It is easy, just execute command `targets::tar_make()` and look for the generated files in the `output/` directory and/or with the `targets::tar_read(<target name>)` (e.g., `targets::tar_read(model)`) commands.
